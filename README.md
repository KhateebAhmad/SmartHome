# SmartHome
Repository for Distributed Systems Group project

Project Members:

Khateeb Ahmad
Mohammad Asad Malik
Aaron Fitzgerald

This repo serves as common code repo for the three group members. All the project should will be committed here on a regular basis.

The idea for the project is to develop a smart home solution where all the services will interact with each other using a middleware.
